# coral-reef
This coral reef project develops a reproducible data-analysis pipeline to monitor reef health over time. It integrates cleaned observational data, engineered ecological features, and machine-learning models. The pipeline also provides clear visualizations to track reef degradation and recovery.
This repository contains selected code and excerpts from a project originally hosted on a private group server. Data and some supplementary files have been omitted or replaced with examples for privacy and licensing reasons, but the core analysis, methods, and final report are preserved.
